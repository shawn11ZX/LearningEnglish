# Tim's workshop
### 01. 'was' and 'were' 
was 原来的发音是 /w/, /ɔ:/, / 但是unstresssed时，**was** becomes /wəz/, and also **were** becomes /wə/.

 - I was there when it happened.   
 - We were delighted with the results.  
 - We were having a good time until it rained.   
 - He was feeling much better last night.

### 02. Assimilation of /t/ and /p/ ★★★★★

 if one word ends in a /t/ sound and the next word begins in a /p/ sound, the /t/ is pronounced slightly differently. In fact, we pronounce it as if it were almost a /p/ sound.

 - There are lots of grea(t) parks in London.   
 - I love spli(t) pea soup.
 - I ha(te) potatoes.      
 - My ma(te) picked us up from the airport.

### 03. And ★★★★★ 

**And** is not usually an important word. It’s a basic conjunction and it's frequently unstressed. When this happens, the /d/ at the end of the word disappears before both vowels and consonants, and the vowel sound at the beginning of the word changes to schwa: /ə/, so **and** becomes /ən/ or even /n/ as the sounds are almost identical.

- I'm going to go and get the shopping.  
- Apples and oranges are my favourite fruits.  
- I’ve been thinking and thinking but I can't decide.  
- We went for a coffee and something to eat.

### 04. Schwa ★★★★★
The words 'a' and 'of' are both pronounced as **/ə/** and they're not stressed. This sound **/ə/** is the most common sound in the whole English language. It's so common that it even has its own name – schwa.

- I like **a** cup **of** tea in the morning.  
- Could you get **a** packet **of** biscuits?  
- C**a**n y**ou** give it t**o** me?  
- I had **a**n apple f**or** lunch t**o**day.


### 05. Linking /r/
War and Peace.
The word after war begins with a vowel sound. And in this case, the 'r' is pronounced. War and Peace, War and Peace. This is called a 'linking r' and it helps to make the words flow together more smoothly in natural speech

- You know, I really like my mothe**r-i**n-law.  
- Have you been to the Towe**r o**f London?  
- You've got something in you**r e**ye.  
- Neve**r a**gain!

### 06. Have to ★★★★★

When we use the verb ‘have’ in its modal form: ‘have to’ meaning an obligation, the /v/ at the end of the word changes to an /f/. Also the vowel sound in the word ‘to’ changes to a schwa - /ə/. ‘Have to’ becomes /hæftə/.

- They **have to** be there by 10.  
- We **have to** find another flat.  
- You **have to** tell me the gossip.  
- I always **have to** take the train.

### 07. Intrusive /r/

In fluent speech, if a word ends in an /ɔː/ sound, like **law** and the next word begins in an /ə/, you'll often hear a /r/ sound linking them together. **Law-r-and** order. **Law-r-and** order. '**Law-r-and** order' is easier to say than 'law and order'. It flows better.

And this is called intrusion.

- Can you dr**aw a** circle freehand?  
- My dog hurt its p**aw o**n some broken glass.  
- There was a fl**aw i**n the argument.  
- I s**aw a** good film last night.

### 08. Elision of /t/ ★★★★★

n everyday speech, when a /t/ sound comes in between two consonant sounds, we often don't pronounce it. This is because it makes the words flow together more fluently. It's more difficult to say three consonants together in a row when /t/ is in the middle. Your mouth has to do too much work. 'I can't do it' is more difficult to say than 'I can't do it'. When a sound disappears in between two words, it's called elision.

- I can'**t** stand the rain.  
- It mus**t** be time to leave  
- Am I the firs**t** person here?  
- I don'**t** want it.




### 10. Assimilation of /t/ followed by /j/ ★★★★★

In fluent speech, when one word ends in /t/ and the next begins with a /j/ sound, like 'you' or 'yours', then the two sounds come together and change to /ʧ/. So 'meet you' becomes **/mi****ːʧ****u****ː****/**.

- That shirt won't sui**t y**ou.  
- Don'**t y**ou want to come to the party?  
- I be**t y**our boss doesn’t know.  
- Can I ge**t y**ou anything?

### 11. Assimilation of /nd/ ★★★★★

Instead of 'sandwich', we hear 'samwich'. That's pretty crazy, right! So, what is going on? Well, first the /d/ disappears in between two consonants. You might remember this from our video on elision. So 'sandwich' becomes 'sa**n**wich'. Now, we have an /n/ followed by a /w/ and /n/ changes to /m/ before /w/.

- My gra**ndp**arents have been married for 50 years.  
- I got a sta**ndb**y ticket.  
- The ba**nd p**layed until midnight.  
- I left my ha**ndb**ag on the train.

### 12. Elision of /d/ ★★★★★
It’s very difficult to say /d/ when it comes in between two other consonants. Your mouth has to do a lot of work. So in many cases the /d/ is not pronounced. '**Boiled potatoes** becomes '**boilpotatoes**'. And '**steamed potatoes**' becomes **steampotatoes**. This is called elision. Here are some more examples.

- My best frien**d** let me borrow his car.  
- Don’t hol**d** back - say what you mean.  
- His bike roll**ed** down the hill without him.

### 13. Can

In fluent everyday English, when the modal auxiliary 'can' is unstressed, its pronunciation changes to /kən/. 'I /kæn/ speak four languages' becomes: 'I /kən/ speak four languages'. This is what's known as a weak form and it can occur in questions as well. Here are some more examples.

- Can you help me bring in the shopping, please?  
- I can swim further than I can run.  
- You can succeed if you work hard.  
- How far can you throw a tennis ball?

### 14. Assimilation of /d/ to /g/ ★★★★★
In fluent speech, a /d/ changes to a /g/ when it comes before a /g/ or a /k/. So 'bad girl' becomes 'bagirl'. This is an example of what is called assimilation. Here are some more.
- He’s a really goo**d c**ook.  
- Last night we ha**d g**uests for dinner.  
- Can you print out the har**d c**opy?  
- I’d love to walk down the re**d c**arpet one day.

### 15. Consonant - vowel linking

In fluent English, when one word ends in a consonant sound and the next word begins in a vowel sound, we link the two sounds together without a pause in between them. So, **an egg** becomes **anegg**. This is called catenation.

**He’s in** the garden.  
- I used to **believe in** Father Christmas, but **not any** more.  
- I had to **give up** jogging.  
- He **had it** in his office.

### 16.Would you...
In fluent speech when one word ends in a /d/ sound and the next word begins in a /j/ sound, the two sounds come together and change to a /ʤ/ sound. You also might have noticed that the /uː/ in 'you' can change to schwa. So 'would you' becomes 'woul**/ʤ/**ou', or even ‘woul**/ʤə/**’ This is an example of assimilation.

- I’m sa**d you** decided to quit.  
- Coul**d you** get here by midnight?  
- Shoul**d you** see him, can you give him a message?  
- I don’t think the gol**d you** bought was real.

### 17. Assimilation of /n/ followed by /p/
when one word ends in the sound /n/ and the next word begins with a /p/, /b/, /w/ or /m/ sound, then the /n/ from the end of the word changes to an /m/ sound as your mouth gets ready to pronounce the next sound. 'Green Park' becomes 'Greempark'. Watch again - this time in slow motion. Look at the mouth shape. Can you see /n/, or /m/?

- Green park
- I own ten pairs of socks.  
- He didn't do it on purpose.  
- I would love to live in Paris.  
- Can you come on Wednesday?



### 18. The
If it’s not stressed, the pronunciation of the word **the** will change depending on the word that follows. If the next word begins in a consonant sound, it’s pronounced /ðə/. I prefer **the blue** one. But, if the next word begins in a vowel sound, it’s pronounced /ðɪː/. I prefer **the orange** one.

- In a restaurant, I always order **the** apple pie.  
- I think **the** autumn is **the** best time of year.  
- **The** earlier I get up, **the** happier I am.  
- It’s **the** one over there.

### 19. twining of /s/ ★★★★★

When one word ends in a /s/ sound and the next word begins in /s/, we don't pronounce both sounds, nor do we pronounce just one sound. Instead they come together to make a slightly longer 's' sound. So, 'he looks sad' becomes 'he lookssad'. This is called 'twinning' or gemination.

- She's silly.  
- He's sitting over there.  
- Can you come this Saturday?  
- That's so unfair!
### 20. Been

In fluent everyday English, when the auxiliary 'been' is not stressed its pronunciation changes to /bɪn/. 'I've been in London since 2015' becomes 'I've /bɪn/ in London since 2015'. This is what's known as a weak form and it helps speech to flow more naturally and fluently.

- I've **been** working here for several years.  
- How long have you **been** waiting?  
- It's **been** years since I went to the cinema.  
- What have you **been** up to since we last met?




### 21. Plosives
We make the sounds of English in different ways, using different parts of our mouths. There's a group of consonants called plosives, and if this sounds a bit like the word 'explosion', well, that's not a bad way of remembering it. Plosive sounds are made by suddenly releasing air that has been blocked by various parts of the mouth. The sound /d/ is one of these plosives. The others are /b/, /t/, /p/, /k/ and /g/. But in fluent, everyday speech, when one word ends in a plosive sound and the next begins in another consonant sound, we don’t always hear the release of the plosive sound. 'I'd like to', becomes 'Idliketuh'. This is called 'an unreleased stop', or, if you want to get really technical, 'a stop with no audible release'.

- How about a qui**ck**  **ch**at?  
- You shoul**d**  **th**ank her.  
- It was a sa**d**  **t**ime in his life.  
- Why don't you si**t**  **d**own?

### 22. assimilation of /t/ followed by /k/
In fluent speech, when one word ends in a **vowel sound** followed by a **/t/** and the next word **begins with a /k/**, the **/t/ changes to a /k/**. So /kredɪt kɑːd/ becomes /kredɪk kɑːd/. It's an example of assimilation

- Don't let it ge**t c**old!  
- You have to do i**t q**uickly.  
- There's no shor**t c**ut to learning a language.  
- I didn't like tha**t c**ake.

### 23. Contracted 'have'
When the verb  **have** is used as an auxiliary it’s often contracted. And when it comes after a consonant sound it’s pronounced /əv/. So, ‘I’d have been late’ becomes ‘I’d’ve been late’. This pronunciation is very common in conditional sentences, but it’s not the only time you’ll hear it. Here are some more examples.

 
 - Your parcel should**’ve**  been delivered yesterday.  
- I would**’ve**  done it differently.  
- We might**’ve**  made a mistake.  
- The police**’ve**  arrived.

### 24. Linking /j/


### 25. Elision of /h/ ★★★★★
In fluent speech, if the word ‘he’ comes at the beginning of a sentence or clause, then the ‘h’ sound /h/ is pronounced. But if it comes in the middle of a sentence or clause and after a consonant, then the ‘h’ sound is not usually pronounced. So **/hi****ː****/** becomes **/i****ː****/** and ‘he looks like **he**’s had an accident’ becomes ‘he looks like ‘**e**’s had an accident’. Not this change also happens with certain other words beginning with the ‘h’ sound, like **him**, **his** or **her**. Here are some more examples.

- I really like **his** cooking.  
- We think **he**’s left the country.  
- They let **him** leave early.  
- They offered **her** a promotion.

### 26. assimilation of /s/
In fluent speech, when a /s/ sound is followed by a /j/ then the /s/ changes to a /ʃ/ sound, and this change also happens if the next word begins with the /ʃ/ sound itself. So 'bless you' becomes 'bleshyou' and 'this shirt' becomes 'thishirt'. This is an example of assimilation. And don't forget this can also happen if the /s/ is followed by a /t/, because as you might remember from a previous video, the /t/ sound disappears between two consonants. Here are some more examples.'
- Can you just shut the door please?!  
- This yacht is beautiful.  
- Don't worry, that's usual.  
- He always makes you feel good.

### 27. The gemination of /t/ ★★★★★
You might remember from a previous video that when the sound /t/ comes in between two consonants, we don’t usually pronounce it.

**But what happens if there is a vowel sound before the /t/? and the next word also begins with /t/?

**Well, in this case the two /t/ sounds join together to create one slightly stronger /t/. So ‘it takes two’ becomes 'i**t t**akes two'. This is an example of twinning or gemination. Here are some more examples.

- I**t t**ook him twenty years to ge**t t**o the top.  
- You don’t have to chea**t t**o pass the test.  
- You were righ**t t**o be upset.  
- We took the overnigh**t t**rain to Venice.

### 28. assimilation of /d/ and /b/ ★★★★★

In everyday speech, when we’re speaking fluently, if one word ends in a **vowel** sound followed by a **/d/** and the next begins in a **/b/**, then the **/d/** changes to a **/b/** and then merges with the **/b/ from the following word**. So ‘speed boat’, becomes ‘spee**bb**oat’. Watch again, this time in slow motion.

- My son is a really goo**d b**oy.  
- I’m sorry if I was ru**de b**efore.  
- My car had to be towe**d b**ack to the garage.  
- You shoul**d b**uy him a present.


### 29. Summary

#### We've learned that /t/ and /d/ sounds disappear between consonants:
- 'Mashe**d p**otato' becomes **/mæʃpəˈteɪtəʊ/**.

#### Consonant sounds can link with vowel sounds:

- **'A**n e**gg' becomes **anegg**.

#### Certain vowel sounds can link with certain other vowel sounds by adding sounds:

- 'The sho**e i**s…' becomes **the shoe/w/is**…

#### Two consonant sounds can join together, or twin.
- 'I**t t**akes two' becomes **/ɪt:eɪks tuː/**.

#### Some sounds can change completely:

- 'Green Park' **/griːn pɑːk/** becomes **/griːmpɑːk/**.

#### Unstressed grammar words are often weak:

- 'I'd have been late' becomes **/aɪdəv bɪn leɪt/**

#### And we've also seen how a little sound, schwa, is important to the rhythm of natural spoken English.

- 'A piece of cake' **/ə piːsə keɪk/**
### 30. From

The word **from** is a preposition; it's usually not that important in a sentence, so it's often unstressed. Now, at the end of the question, "Where do you come from?" It's unstressed, but it is still pronounced /frɒm/. However, when it's unstressed, and it comes in the middle of a sentence, the /ɒ/ changes to schwa, so /frɒm/ becomes /frəm/. This is an example of a weak form


- I borrowed it **from** my brother.  
- I read the book **from** cover to cover.  
- The nearest post office is not far **from** here.  
- Come over any time **from** seven o'clock.
