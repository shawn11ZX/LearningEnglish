### 'was' and 'were'
was 原来的发音是 /w/, /ɔ:/, / 但是unstresssed时，**was** becomes /wəz/, and also **were** becomes /wə/.

 - I was there when it happened.   
 - We were delighted with the results.

 - He was feeling much better last night.

### Assimilation of /t/ and /p/

 if one word ends in a /t/ sound and the next word begins in a /p/ sound, the /t/ is pronounced slightly differently. In fact, we pronounce it as if it were almost a /p/ sound.
