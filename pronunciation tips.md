### 'was' and 'were'
was 原来的发音是 /w/, /ɔ:/, / 但是unstresssed时，**was** becomes /wəz/, and also **were** becomes /wə/.

 - I was there when it happened.   
 - We were delighted with the results.  
 - We were having a good time until it rained.   
 - He was feeling much better last night.

### Assimilation of /t/ and /p/

 if one word ends in a /t/ sound and the next word begins in a /p/ sound, the /t/ is pronounced slightly differently. In fact, we pronounce it as if it were almost a /p/ sound.

 - There are lots of grea(t) parks in London.   
 - I love spli(t) pea soup.
 - I ha(te) potatoes.      
 - My ma(te) picked us up from the airport.

### And

**And** is not usually an important word. It’s a basic conjunction and it's frequently unstressed. When this happens, the /d/ at the end of the word disappears before both vowels and consonants, and the vowel sound at the beginning of the word changes to schwa: /ə/, so **and** becomes /ən/ or even /n/ as the sounds are almost identical.

- I'm going to go and get the shopping.  
- Apples and oranges are my favourite fruits.  
- I’ve been thinking and thinking but I can't decide.  
- We went for a coffee and something to eat.

### Schwa
The words 'a' and 'of' are both pronounced as **/ə/** and they're not stressed. This sound **/ə/** is the most common sound in the whole English language. It's so common that it even has its own name – schwa.

- I like **a** cup **of** tea in the morning.  
- Could you get **a** packet **of** biscuits?  
- C**a**n y**ou** give it t**o** me?  
- I had **a**n apple f**or** lunch t**o**day.


### Linking /r/
War and Peace.
The word after war begins with a vowel sound. And in this case, the 'r' is pronounced. War and Peace, War and Peace. This is called a 'linking r' and it helps to make the words flow together more smoothly in natural speech

- You know, I really like my mothe**r-i**n-law.  
- Have you been to the Towe**r o**f London?  
- You've got something in you**r e**ye.  
- Neve**r a**gain!

### Have to

When we use the verb ‘have’ in its modal form: ‘have to’ meaning an obligation, the /v/ at the end of the word changes to an /f/. Also the vowel sound in the word ‘to’ changes to a schwa - /ə/. ‘Have to’ becomes /hæftə/.

- They **have to** be there by 10.  
- We **have to** find another flat.  
- You **have to** tell me the gossip.  
- I always **have to** take the train.

### Intrusive /r/

In fluent speech, if a word ends in an /ɔː/ sound, like **law** and the next word begins in an /ə/, you'll often hear a /r/ sound linking them together. **Law-r-and** order. **Law-r-and** order. '**Law-r-and** order' is easier to say than 'law and order'. It flows better.

And this is called intrusion.

- Can you dr**aw a** circle freehand?  
- My dog hurt its p**aw o**n some broken glass.  
- There was a fl**aw i**n the argument.  
- I s**aw a** good film last night.

### Elision of /t/

n everyday speech, when a /t/ sound comes in between two consonant sounds, we often don't pronounce it. This is because it makes the words flow together more fluently. It's more difficult to say three consonants together in a row when /t/ is in the middle. Your mouth has to do too much work. 'I can't do it' is more difficult to say than 'I can't do it'. When a sound disappears in between two words, it's called elision.

- I can'**t** stand the rain.  
- It mus**t** be time to leave  
- Am I the firs**t** person here?  
- I don'**t** want it.
