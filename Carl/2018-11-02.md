### review
Long/Hard Vowel Sounds: Were the same as the name of the letter. For example, cat.

Silent Vowel not only  does it not make a sound it also makes the preceding  Vowel have a Long/Hard S ound
- boat
- been/bean = same sound
- scene/seen = same sound
- Bain
- bought

ea = has 3 sounds
- Long E = bean
- Short e = head, bread, dead
- Long A = Break/brake  = same sound, day, date, ate
	- day = d A -E
	- date = d A-E t
	- ate = A -E t
	- ate/eight = same sound
	- weight/wait = same sound
	- weigh/way = same sound

how to distinguish wit and wait?
- ban, ben, bin, bon (dage), bun
- sat, set, sity, sought, sut
- sit
- and, end
- man, men

me , mean, eat
- me = m E -E
- mean = m E-E n
- eat  = E-E t

What Shawn pronuanced( is wrong) :
- m E-E
- m E-i n
- E t

match
catch
my , mine, ice 

my = m I  -E
mine =  m I-E n
ice = I-E s
